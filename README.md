## Project name: Laboratory assistant spreadsheet

### Objective:

Create a spreadsheet to easily structure reaction. The user would only need to enter the name of the chemical compound and one of three pieces of information: concentration, mass/volume or equivalent. The remaining information will be calculated automatically.Other information (density, molar mass, etc.) are necessary to calculate other information.

### Coding:
- Need a database of the x most widely used compounds in the world 
- Need different functions to calculate different parameters
- Make a nice graphical interface
-  Other
