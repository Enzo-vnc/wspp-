#  Water Solubility Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict the water solubility of chemical compounds using machine learning techniques. The models developed here can be used to estimate the solubility of new compounds only using the SMILES code of the compounds, which can be valuable in various industries such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and environmental science.

## Project Structure
- The project is structured as follows:
- Import Relevant Modules and Libraries
- Data Collection
- Data Cleaning
- Calculation of RDkit Molecular Descriptors
- Select Machine Learning Models
- Fine-tuning
