Guidelines and Evaluation Criteria:

Code Repository and Python Package (30%)

- Contribution from all team members
- Organization, quality, and clarity of the code repository and Python package (see this project as an example for the organization -> https://github.com/pschwllr/minimal_project, you can obtain the same template for your project using https://github.com/schwallergroup/copier-liac-minimal)
- Completeness of README file (it should be clear how to install and use the package)
- Functions/classes/modules documented with doc strings (potential Sphinx integration for automated API documentation)
- Tests for the package functionality (one or more tests per function)
